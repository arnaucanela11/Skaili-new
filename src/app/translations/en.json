  "question1": "Can we start your project on any date?",

  "text2": "Obviously, all projects have different needs, but on average, the duration of each project is about 10 days.",
  "question3": "What is the average price of a project?",
  "text3": "Considering that all projects have particular features and needs, and the price depends entirely on those, the average price for the no code projects is over 250$, and the average price for the code projects is over 350$.",

  "text4": "You will have two people (one designer and one developer) working on your project.",
  "question5": "Who will provide the media files for the project?",
  "text5": "We will try to make the process as easy and simple as possible for you, but we might need you to provide specific media (such as photos or videos) in order to achieve the desired result.",
  "question6": "What will be the relationship between Skaili agency and you once the project is finished?",
  "text6": "We will act as a digital service provider and therefore will provide the support you need in that area, assisting you with any issues even after the project is completed and payment is made, as long as the issue in question is not of too large proportions (in which case we will treat it as a new project).",
  "question7": "What happens if I ultimately don't like the result?",
  "text7": "The idea is for us to receive some feedback from you during the digitization process. However, if you are ultimately not satisfied with the delivered product, we can either make some final adjustments, or if the issue is significant, we can cancel the contract. This way, the website wouldn't be delivered, and no payment would be required.",
