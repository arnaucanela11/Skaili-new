  "text6": "We will act as a digital service provider and therefore will provide the support you need in that area, assisting you with any issues even after the project is completed and payment is made, as long as the issue in question is not of too large proportions (in which case we will treat it as a new project).",
  "question7": "What happens if I ultimately don't like the result?",
  "text7": "The idea is for us to receive some feedback from you during the digitization process. However, if you are ultimately not satisfied with the delivered product, we can either make some final adjustments, or if the issue is significant, we can cancel the contract. This way, the website wouldn't be delivered, and no payment would be required.",
